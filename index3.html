      <p>The purpose of Boracay Information Technology Association (BITA) is to build
        relationship between the community and other sectors of society (business,
        governments, hotels, resorts, etc.) within Boracay and nearby provinces. Our
        association is composed of IT Specialists in the island of Boracay that aims to deepen
        the general public awareness and understanding of technology through attending
        technological updates, facilitate technological advancement and partnership with
        various technological vendors. Our program also involves connecting our members
        through technology, networking opportunities and in developing and supporting local
        community and business sectors. Through the use of technology and social media, we
        aim to advocate patronage, community service, volunteerism and to ensure that
        useful information can benefit the communities, businesses and general public. </p>
